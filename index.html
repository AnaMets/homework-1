            <p>On 22th of April millions people over the world celebrated Earth Day.
            According to Wiki, Earth Day is an annual event. Worldwide, various 
            events are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection.

            <p>The concept of Earth Day was established in 1969 at a UNESCO 
            Conference in San Francisco.   On March 21, 1970, a sanctioned 
            Proclamation was signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations.
            On April 22, 1970, U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson founded Earth Day. 
            National Earth Day is not considered a national holiday.</p>

            <h3>3 THINGS WE’VE LEARNED ABOUT EARTH SINCE THE LAST EARTH DAY</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>The plastic problem is even worse than we thought</h4>
                <p>The plastic crisis is a truly global one, and the numbers are staggering: 
                A 2015 study found that between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tons of 
                plastic makes it into the ocean from land each year. By 2050, 
                there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by weight.</p>

                </li>
                <li><h4>Greenland’s ice is melting faster than we realized</h4>
                <p>This warming is playing out in sharp and sudden ways across the Arctic.
                Researchers reported last year that a section of Greenland’s ice 
                sheet suddenly started melting 80 percent faster. Another study
                found Greenland’s entire ice sheet is melting at its fastest rate 
                in at least 400 years, and that the melt rate sped up drastically 
                in 1990.</p>

                </li>
                <li><h4>We’re getting closer to finding another Earth out there</h4>
                <p>As far as we know, Earth is the only planet with life in the universe. 
                But scientists are getting better at finding tantalizingly similar planets. 
                And as astrophysics and astrobiology come together to make these discoveries, 
                we keep learning more about our own home.

                There’s been a boom in exoplanet discoveries since the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope in 2009.
                Of the more than 3,500 planets we’ve found outside of our solar system, 
                Kepler has helped identify more than 2,500 of them.</p>
